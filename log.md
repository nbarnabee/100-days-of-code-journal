# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished Class 27 of #100Devs and coded along with Leon as he made a basic card game.  Added some additional fields to my NASA Photo of the Day site, including a date picker, and refactored the code to make it MUCH cleaner.  To do:  use localStorage to allow users to save their favorite images and access them later.

**Thoughts:** I was pleased to be able to keep up with Leon, even at 1.5 speed, though between the Cocktail picker and what I'd already done with the NASA site, I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on how to manipulate API data and insert it into the DOM.  From time to time I think about how I might implement some of this stuff using the OOP model, but I still don't have a very good grasp of that.

### Day 2: April 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Wrote and published the Pitch Generator that I'd been thinking about.

**Thoughts:**  The JS portion worked flawlessly (once I remembered to add the script tag to the HTML!).  Styling the page took me some time, but I'm very pleased with how it turned out.  Also, I probably shouldn't laugh at my own jokes so much.
