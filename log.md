# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished Class 27 of #100Devs and coded along with Leon as he made a basic card game.  Added some additional fields to my NASA Photo of the Day site, including a date picker, and refactored the code to make it MUCH cleaner.  To do:  use localStorage to allow users to save their favorite images and access them later.

**Thoughts:** I was pleased to be able to keep up with Leon, even at 1.5 speed, though between the Cocktail picker and what I'd already done with the NASA site, I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on how to manipulate API data and insert it into the DOM.  From time to time I think about how I might implement some of this stuff using the OOP model, but I still don't have a very good grasp of that.

### Day 2: April 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Wrote and published the Pitch Generator that I'd been thinking about.  Did a 6 kyu CodeWars problem and felt very good about it.  (My initial solution was spot on; it just ran into some issues with case sensitivity that I hadn't anticipated but could easily solve.)

**Thoughts:**  The JS portion of my Pitch Generator worked flawlessly (once I remembered to add the script tag to the HTML!).  Styling the page took me some time, but I'm very pleased with how it turned out.  Also, I probably shouldn't laugh at my own jokes so much.  I  still need to return to the NASA site and do two more simple API sites.

### Day 3: April 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started and finished the JS portion of the Trivia Trainer project.

**Thoughts:** Creating a mental map of the project was a bit difficult, and I kept going around in circles.  Had to stop myself at one point and start from the beginning, just to see if I could get the basics to work; my inclination, as usual, was to write EVERYTHING and then test.  Was pleased that I managed to stop myself and take it step by step.  At one point I felt I had coded myself into a corner in terms of being able to test the answers, but after consulting with my father and taking another look, I came up with a solution.
<br><br>In the end, I managed to get it working, although I didn't have time to do any CSS.  Will have to make another pass and style it before I could put it into my portfolio.  It would also be a good candidate for conversion to an OOP approach.

### Day 4: April 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Was out of the house for most of the day, but got started on a "Quote of the Day" generator.

**Thoughts:** I spent way too long trying to solve a CORS error without knowing what it was.  If I'd bothered to do a tiny bit of research, I would have learned that it wasn't my fault and that there was nothing I could have done about it.  As usual, I am my own worst enemy.

### Day 5: April 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the "Quote of the Day" page.

**Thoughts:** I kept changing my mind about what I actually wanted the page to do, and that caused me to spend a long time going around in circles.  In the future, I need to come up with a clear plan and stick to it.  I also struggled to work with the results I was getting back from Lorem Picsum.  The end result was that this project took me a lot longer than it should have done, considering how simple it is.

### Day 6: April 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Stepped away from the API projects and restarted Codecademy's Intro to JS course, as a refresher.  (And as a Pro member, I can now do all of the exercises.)  Also worked on improving my Anki deck.  Quite frankly, it was a depressingly code-light day.

**Thoughts:** It was good to take a day off, but I shouldn't get in the habit of it.  I'm largely trying to avoid working on my resume and portfolio, and that is a bad habit to get in to.  On the other hand, I *am* technically on vacation right now.



### Day 7: April 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work through the Codecademy course.

**Thoughts:** I flew through the JS course before and now I'm doing it even more quickly.  If I want more JS practice, it would be a good idea to start freecodecamp's JS unit and complete the fundamentals track of TOP.  In short, there's plenty of practice material out there.
