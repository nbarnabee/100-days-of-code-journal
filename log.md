# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished Class 27 of #100Devs and coded along with Leon as he made a basic card game.  Added some additional fields to my NASA Photo of the Day site, including a date picker, and refactored the code to make it MUCH cleaner.  To do:  use localStorage to allow users to save their favorite images and access them later.

**Thoughts:** I was pleased to be able to keep up with Leon, even at 1.5 speed, though between the Cocktail picker and what I'd already done with the NASA site, I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on how to manipulate API data and insert it into the DOM.  From time to time I think about how I might implement some of this stuff using the OOP model, but I still don't have a very good grasp of that.

### Day 2: April 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Wrote and published the Pitch Generator that I'd been thinking about.  Did a 6 kyu CodeWars problem and felt very good about it.  (My initial solution was spot on; it just ran into some issues with case sensitivity that I hadn't anticipated but could easily solve.)

**Thoughts:**  The JS portion of my Pitch Generator worked flawlessly (once I remembered to add the script tag to the HTML!).  Styling the page took me some time, but I'm very pleased with how it turned out.  Also, I probably shouldn't laugh at my own jokes so much.  I  still need to return to the NASA site and do two more simple API sites.

### Day 3: April 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started and finished the JS portion of the Trivia Trainer project.

**Thoughts:** Creating a mental map of the project was a bit difficult, and I kept going around in circles.  Had to stop myself at one point and start from the beginning, just to see if I could get the basics to work; my inclination, as usual, was to write EVERYTHING and then test.  Was pleased that I managed to stop myself and take it step by step.  At one point I felt I had coded myself into a corner in terms of being able to test the answers, but after consulting with my father and taking another look, I came up with a solution.
<br><br>In the end, I managed to get it working, although I didn't have time to do any CSS.  Will have to make another pass and style it before I could put it into my portfolio.  It would also be a good candidate for conversion to an OOP approach.

### Day 4: April 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Was out of the house for most of the day, but got started on a "Quote of the Day" generator.

**Thoughts:** I spent way too long trying to solve a CORS error without knowing what it was.  If I'd bothered to do a tiny bit of research, I would have learned that it wasn't my fault and that there was nothing I could have done about it.  As usual, I am my own worst enemy.

### Day 5: April 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the "Quote of the Day" page.

**Thoughts:** I kept changing my mind about what I actually wanted the page to do, and that caused me to spend a long time going around in circles.  In the future, I need to come up with a clear plan and stick to it.  I also struggled to work with the results I was getting back from Lorem Picsum.  The end result was that this project took me a lot longer than it should have done, considering how simple it is.

### Day 6: April 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Coded along with Class 28, though it was mostly a review of things I'd already done with my own projects; I didn't feel that I really learned anything.  Made a list of improvements I'd like to make to my API projects but didn't do any work on them; instead I restarted Codecademy's Intro to JS course as a refresher and worked on improving my Anki deck.

**Thoughts:** I didn't really do any coding today aside from following along with Leon; the Codecademy stuff is so basic that I can't really count it.  I'm largely trying to avoid working on my resume and portfolio, and that is a bad habit to get in to.  On the other hand, I *am* technically on vacation right now.



### Day 7: April 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work through the Codecademy JS course, did several Codewars problems, and added many more cards to my Anki deck.

**Thoughts:** I flew through the JS course before and now I'm doing it even more quickly.  If I want more JS practice, it would be a good idea to start freecodecamp's JS unit and complete the fundamentals track of TOP.  In short, there's plenty of practice material out there.



### Day 8: April 23, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added functions to the NASA Image of the Day site to allow users to add and remove favorites.

**Thoughts:**  Very happy with how this went.  As usual, I stumbled on a few typo-induced errors, but there was nothing wrong with the reasoning behind my approach.  It would do me good to learn more about Sets, Dates, and the HTMLInputElement interface.

### Day 9: April 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked through another section of Codeacdemy's Intro to JS course (again, amazing how much faster it's going this time; I really have made progress!) and did the Intro to UI/UX course.

**Thoughts:** Knowing all of this jargon would have been helpful when I was doing the hackathon project!  A lot of it still feels like bullshit, but there are some useful bits of information to be gleaned from the design methodologies; if nothing else, it's given me something to think about when I consider what sort of features I want to include in a project.  And it has definitely given me a better handle on how to approach the visual design stage of a project, rather than just leaping into the CSS and imagining that it will all magically work out with enough tweaking.



### Day 10: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Quickly wrote some CSS to solve a problem my father was having, talked him through it, wrote some more.  A low-code day.

**Thoughts:** Although I didn't do a lot, it felt good to help my father out (and even better to have known something that he didn't know).  I should take more time in my day to share knowledge.  It feels good and it's good for me.



### Day 11: April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Less progress than I would have liked.  Did some Codewars and a little more of the Codecademy JS course, but the day was mostly taken up by the family.

**Thoughts:** As much as I know I shouldn't begrudge my kids and parents for the time I spend with them, it's hard not to feel frustrated when I finish a day and feel that I haven't really gone forward.  And as the next several days are going to be busy, I doubt I'll be getting a lot done until the weekend.  Oh well.



### Day 12: April 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did quite a number of Codewars kata and worked through two more of the Codecademy JavaScript lessons.

**Thoughts:** I think I need to stop doing the 8 kyu katas; they are simply too easy now.  On the other hand, I still make a number of careless syntactical errors, so perhaps I shouldn't be so quick to move on -- part of my problem is impatience and complacency.  Similarly, the JS review is feeling very basic.  I'm pleased with how easy it is now, and frustrated that the exercises force me to do things in a simpler fashion.  I don't expect to get much of anything done tomorrow or the day after, since we'll be travelling.  I feel like I've been treading water these past few days, but on the other hand there's not a lot that I can do about it.  We'll be home Saturday and I can get properly back to work.



### Day 13: May 1, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished last Tuesday's 100Devs class.  More Codecademy and Codewars. 

**Thoughts:**  I went over the top with answering some basic questions, wrote classes and such to make a Pok√®mon constructor, and was duly proud of myself.  Otherwise, I didn't get as much done as I had hoped, due to mental fatigue.



### Day 14: May 2, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  The usual Codewars and Codecademy work, plus the chapter on OOP from *The JS Way*.  Tried to catch up with *Eloquent Javascript*.  

**Thoughts:**  My brain was still tired and fuzzy and once again I didn't do as much as I would have liked.  But I was pleased to have sailed through the *JS Way* problems; it seemed very straightforward.  Unfortunately, I got hung up for the second time on the linked list question in chapter 4 of *Eloquent Javascript*.  Eventually gave up and looked at the solution, and I can safely say that I would not have come up with it on my own.  Have gathered more material to read about linked lists.  I also shouldn't let myself grind to a halt because I can't answer a question.



### Day 15: May 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Came back from a 1-day sanity break feeling energized and ready to code.  Finished last Thursday's 100Devs class and wrote a tic-tac-toe game, then refactored the code to get it somewhat in line with the OOP paradigm.

**Thoughts:** Am very glad that I took yesterday off.  Felt much better today.  Was very proud of my game.  However, I was not very satisfied with my OOP rewrite.  I made one object and dropped all of the functions inside it, and came away feeling that I had missed the point.



### Day 16: May 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished the Codecacdemy Intro to JS and got part of the way through Tuesday's VOD.  But most of my energy was focused on getting my Tic-Tac-Toe computer opponent up to speed.  I took a brute-force approach to the logic, but it did work.

**Thoughts:** I'm very pleased with what I got done today.  I know a Tic-Tac-Toe game is not exactly a portfolio-worthy project, and my code is pretty ugly, but I got it to do what I wanted.  I took a look at some of Codecademy's "intermediate" JS offerings, and they seem to be going over the same things that we have done/are shortly going to do in #100Devs.  It might make for a worthy review.  However, I should probably concentrate more on my own projects.



### Day 17: May 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I didn't get much done today.  Continued catching up with the VODs and did a few Codewars problems, continuing with that "beginners" set.  Took many notes.

**Thoughts:** I struggle with motivation when I'm not actively working on a project.  Another European cohort member suggested some of us work together on a Tic-Tac-Toe game, but I couldn't quite figure his code out.  Part of the problem is that I am so in love with the approach I took that it is hard to wrap my head around anything different.



### Day 18: May 7, 2022

**Today's Progress:** At long last, I genuinely caught up with the VODs.  I read a bit about recursive functions and explored the concept by writing a few of my own.  I practiced writing classes and tried to think how they could be applied to my Tic-Tac-Toe game.

**Thoughts:** Motivation continued to be a huge struggle today.  The list of things I need to do keeps building up, and I feel like I'm treading water.  I daydreamed through most of the VODs; we've reached a point again where the slow pace starts to bore and frustrate me.  And yet I struggle to motivate myself to push ahead with, for instance, *Eloquent JavaScript*, or to actually work on my portfolio site or other projects.  

I did manage a tricky Codewars kata in the first go, having actually taken the time to plan it out on paper.  And I wrote a recursive function to solve an early problem in *Eloquent Javascript*, though the learning process involved creating a couple of infinite loops.  But I learned that returning something like `i++` into a recursive function is a bad idea.  It should always be `++i` or just `i+1`



### Day 19: May 9, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Read a bit more *Eloquent JavaScript*, finished up the CSS Grid section of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course, did the first project exercise, and sketched out some vague ideas for the Schwert & Feder overhaul.

**Thoughts:** Taking a closer look at Grid took me down a CSS rabbit hole.  I feel like I did not learn a great deal today, but at least I moved forward a few steps.  I was not happy with my initial redesign of the S&F site, but I think I have some useable ideas.



### Day 20: May 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Made my first-ever pull request to an open source project (albeit one set up deliberately to enable new programmers to practice this), then got more practice in with the git workflow while setting up a group project with some other 100Devs.  Reviewed OOP basics, participated in the writing of some very modest code, did a 6 kyu CodeWars problem, and began rewriting my Cocktail Finder project.

**Thoughts:** Even though my hand was held all the way through the pull request process, it was surprisingly nerve-wracking.  I enjoyed working with the other devs, even if we didn't build much of anything; I was able to offer some advice and corrections and it made me feel almost as though I knew what I was doing.  Then in the evening I had a remote work session with the Girls Code group, where I got to chat a bit and work on the Cocktail Finder.  It took me longer than I anticipated to get going, and just as the evening was wrapping up I had a breakthrough in my thinking.  Looking forward to continuing the work tomorrow.



### Day 21: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Made more headway with the Cocktail Finder project.  The rest of the day's work was centered around watching the last class VOD, which was about networking and the job hunt, and working on my personal story and my LinkedIn page.

**Thoughts:** I'm pleased with how the Cocktail Finder is shaping up, though as usual there's a lot of trial and error and it seems to take me ten times as long as it should.  CSS Grid does not seem to be playing nicely with what I'm trying to do, and I have no idea why that would be.  Even though it was not coding related, I was happy to have finally written my personal story (though I'm sure I will refine it later) and to have added at least that much more to my LinkedIn profile.



### Day 22: May 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did a lot of reading about promises, event handling, and asynchronous functions.  Spent too long trying to work out how to make a method call work with new objects, and eventually stumbled on the .bind() method, which solved the problem.  Also went further with Codecademy's intermediate JS course.

**Thoughts:** Not sure how much of the async information I've retained, aside from the basic idea.  The MDN documentation was somewhat unclear.  Codecademy's course is probably a waste of time for the most part (or, rather, I spent time on it that would have been more usefully spent elsewhere); I was mostly reviewing concepts I already knew, though I did learn a few new things, such as .getElementsByClass and .getElementsByName.  Balancing the things that I want to/need to/should do is an ongoing problem that I'm still not sure how to solve.



### Day 23: May 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued reading about promises.  Fiddled with small code snippets as I tried to figure out setTimeout and setInterval, reduce() and various other things.  Completed a couple of CodeWars problems, but otherwise did not do any concrete work.

**Thoughts:** I'd like to think that I learned something from playing around today, but I'm sure I haven't.  I've already forgotten how I solved the setInterval countdown problem I set myself.  Have not been getting nearly enough sleep lately.



### Day 24: May 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Caught up with the VODs, though since the class was mostly about interview prep, I'm not sure I'd call it "coding."  Finished setting up WSL, caught up on my Anki, which I'd been neglecting, and did a lot of Codewars, including my first 5 kyu.

**Thoughts:** It was quite a confidence boost to go back to easy 8's on Codewars and just knock them out of the park, one by one.  The 5 kyu problem was also easy (though I did deliberately pick the "most solved" one), and my solution was not any worse than the top solutions -- and if we're considering scalability and Big O-type matters, mine was probably better.



### Day 25: May 16, 2022

**Today's Progess:** Had a gratifying Codewars success, relying on that reduce() method that's come up a lot lately.  Checked out a bunch of fonts for the S&F site, watched a video about promises and another about Figma (coded along with the latter, and should probably go back and code along with the former as well).

**Thoughts:** I really need to memorize that method, or at least get the concept solidified in my brain such that I can pull it up from memory (for I did have to consult my notes while solving the Codewars problem).  I think I understand the idea of promises and async/await, but I need to think of a scenario where I can put this into practice.  Feeling more comfortable about Figma and made some sketches that I'll turn into wireframes tomorrow, so that I'll have something to show my client on Thursday.



### Day 26: May 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Had taken a couple of days off, more or less - I did a fair amount of wireframing with Figma, but that's not really programming - and today got started with the Node.js crash course.

**Thoughts:** Once again, I made the mistake of getting frustrated with Javascript Info and had to step away for a few days.  This isn't the first time this has happened.



### Day 27: May 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Coded along with Brad Traversy's Node Crash course.  The video itself was an hour and a half, but with stopping, reviewing, and looking other things up, it took me twice that to get through it.  Then I added the principle bits of server related code to my snippets repo

**Thoughts:** By the end of the course I felt pretty comfortable with what I was doing, though as usual I wouldn't be able to write anything from memory.  I would like to get started with yesterday's VOD, but I don't think I have the mental energy for it right now.



### Day 28: May 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Watched some of mayanwolf's stream, but it moves so slowly that I couldn't stand it.  Fiddled around with the class files while the stream was running and figured out what I was trying to figure out on my own.  Later, wrote a new bunch of code based on my rewrite of the class code and managed to successfully serve myself some data.

**Thoughts:** I was trying to be clever with what I was doing and actually prompted a CORS error on myself!  Rewrote it to be more in line with Leon's code; aka, simple and stupid, but I made it work.  I'm eager to start learning how to compile this information into databases.  I still haven't really figured out error handling.  



### Day 29: May 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Skipped the VOD and went straight into the homework: namely, [Building a Simple CRUD App](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/).  It took me ages to get through and fried my brain, but I did make it to the end.

**Thoughts:** The exercise was equal parts interesting and frustrating.  I had gotten to grips, more or less, with Brad Traversy's approach, and here was something similar and yet totally different.  And so many dependencies!  The one that allows you to write JS in the HTML looked very much like PHP, and not for the first time I wondered if it wouldn't be easier to just mix and match languages, rather than go to these lengths to insert JS into everything.



### Day 30: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** As usual, feeling far behind on everything.  So rather than do something strictly useful I spent my time working on the S&F website.  Admittedly, it is long overdue.

**Thoughts:** I mucked around with templates for a while, but have concluded that they are just not for me.  It is worth keeping them around and trying to copy the designs, I suppose, but trying to modify them is a massive time sink and ultimately doesn't leave me feeling like I'm learning much.  I could tell that I hadn't used CSS in a while, either, but in the end I was reasonably satisfied with my work.  The site is still far from finished, unfortunately.



### Day 31: May 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I worked a little more on the S&F site, and then turned my attention to my own portfolio.  Bookmarked a number of "code along" portfolio tutorials (it would be good practice to follow them, even if I don't end up using any of them) and settled on following Kevin Powell's.

**Thoughts:** I have had a hell of a time settling on a portfolio design, but I think I have finally found something that I'm happy with.  It's a more attractive design than I could have come up with purely on my own, but I have written it myself, tweaked it, and am quite pleased with how it's shaping up.



### Day 32: May 29, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Technically this should be Day 33, as I worked on my portfolio site for quite some time last night, but I didn't Tweet about it or update this journal, so it doesn't count.  Finished up Kevin's tutorial today and was pleased with the result.  On a less encouraging note, I very briefly tried to engage in some group work with other members of the Europe channel, but quickly bowed out.

**Thoughts:** As always, I learned a lot from Kevin.  I have a few other "code along tutorials" bookmarked, and it would probably be good for me to review them at some point in the future.  But as I'm now two classes behind, it's time to pivot back to Node.  I was completely lost during the group work session, though it didn't help that there was no organization whatsoever.  I should see if Anjum and Rajea would like to continue with the Hangman project; I hope I didn't ride too roughshod over them.



### Day 33: May 31, 2022 

**Today's Progress:** I had started last Tuesday's VOD yesterday but hadn't gotten through it.  Finished it up this morning and spent the rest of the day working over the node-backend-simple files.  I had already refactored them once, but did it a second time, spent a lot of time reading the Node.js documentation, and took extensive notes about the process.

**Thoughts:** I spent way too much time on this, but I did come out of it feeling significantly more confident about the process.  And I learned that the Node.js documentation is great.  I am thinking that I will probably turn all of this into a blog post.



### Day 34: June 1, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Watched last Thursday's VOD, which was mostly a review of the node-backend-simple file, so not a lot new there for me.  Also watched the other video about the event loop.  Did quite a few Codewars while chatting with some other #100Devs, discussed a group project with Kirstie and Lukasz, and coded and deployed a little Magic 8-Ball app, since I didn't feel like doing a coin flip.

**Thoughts:** Although Leon's review of the simple Node.js code made me feel like my exhaustive review had been a bit of a waste of time (I did publish it as a blog post), I really knew what was going on, and was able to knock out the Magic 8-Ball app in record time.  Really, it was tinkering with the CSS that took the longest.

**Link to Work:** [Magic 8-Ball](https://magic-8bl.herokuapp.com/) and [Walk-through Refactoring](https://nbarnabee.hashnode.dev/walk-through-refactoring-node-backend-simple)



### Day 35: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Watched Tuesday's VOD -- almost caught up now! -- and coded along as he built the first part of the simple Express API.

**Thoughts:** I was too flummoxed by that CRUD tutorial to really appreciate how much easier Express is to work with than vanilla Node.js, but after having done that deep dive with the first backend project the other day, I was amazed by the difference!



### Day 36: June 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Watched Thursday's VOD, which ended up being a big disappointment, as it was just a lengthier recap of Tuesday's class.  At least it meant I was able to get through it quickly.  Rewrote my "character server" to use Express, then mixed it up completely and started to build it out as a proper REST API.

**Thoughts:** I was incredibly pleased at how easy it was to manipulate the query parameters and return the data I wanted.  It did take a little bit of trial and error, and I'm not sure how best to handle multiple parameters, and the project is not at all scalable (it cries out for a proper database, whereas right now it's just a file containing an array of objects), but I got it going without any trouble.  I have no idea if anyone else would actually want to contribute, but we RPG nerds do love talking about our characters, so maybe someone will.  If nothing else, it's good practice.  

Having promised myself I'd get off of the computer, I instead stayed up late working on the github README for the project.



### Day 37: June 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Had another look at the javascript.info chapter on Asynchronous functions, thinking that it might make more sense now that I have more experience, but no, it didn't.  Practiced rewriting the basic fetch request function as async/await, then async with a try/catch.  Did quite a few Codewars problems and coded along with the office hours.

**Thoughts:** This all probably wasn't a very effective use of my time.  I shouldn't beat myself up over it, but I should make a better plan for tomorrow.



### Day 38: June 7, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Got through most of the fullstackopen Node.js information, though I only had enough time to complete the first exercise.  (They all look extremely easy, however.)

**Thoughts:** I had hoped to get a lot more done today (as with most days), but it didn't happen.  The FSO took a lot longer to get through, but I did take a lot of notes which slowed me down considerably.  I have to make more of an effort to get started in the morning (admittedly, I did do a lot this morning - only none of it was related to coding.)



### Day 39:  June 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the FullStackOpen project.  Took a look at the next section, which goes into MongoDB integration; I'd like to have a closer look later.  Started Tuesday's VOD but didn't get far.  Had an overly long and completely unproductive meeting with Lukasz and Kirstie.

**Thoughts:** Today was another unproductive day.  I am trying not to let that fact get me down.  I fear tomorrow will be more of the same; it's Thursday, which means I'll be out both morning and afternoon.



### Day 40: June 9, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Got up early and wrote out some basic code for the To-Do app project that would allow the client and server to communicate.  I wasn't feeling up to hooking it up to MongoDB yet, so just relied on a non-permanent array of items, just so that we would at least have something to work with.

**Thoughts:** It being Thursday, I was as busy as I had anticipated, so I didn't get much else done (aside from some Anki).  However, getting that much written in an hour did leave me feeling great.



### Day 41: June 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Coded along with Tuesday's class, set up a database to handle the To Do app and rewrote yesterday's code to take that into account (and learned about environmental variables in the process).  Returned to the simple-backend-node code, thinking that I might rewrite it using Express and write a blog post about that.  Got part of the way through it.

**Thoughts:** I feel like today was reasonably productive, but after a while I could definitely feel my enthusiasm for the blog post waning.  I need to go through all of the node_app_practice files, pull out the best examples and explanations that I've got, and make a master file.  I have too many notes scattered about the place.



### Day 42: June 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Did more work with the simple-backend-node code.  Got most of the way through Thursday's VOD.  Did a line-by-line review of the code, with extensive notes, which I will probably turn into a blog post.

**Thoughts:** The full conversion of simple-backend-node was tricker than I'd anticipated and I was not entirely happy with the results.  It took me a rather long time, and I came away feeling that I'd sunk way more time into it than was reasonable.  I need to learn when to step back from a project that's not going anywhere; there were a hundred more useful things I could have been doing with that time.

Wasn't quite able to finish Thursday's VOD, though I am mostly done.  I would like to make another blog post, and since the simple-backend conversion has been such a disappointment, and I took so many notes covering the CRUD app, I think I'll just post about that.  

Also helped a couple of people on the Discord server, which felt good.



### Day 43: June 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finally finished the VOD and am officially caught up with classes.  I need to flesh out some of my notes and then I'll be able to make another blog post; hope to get that done tomorrow.  (Trying to post on a Monday would make sense; I know regularity is important.)  Went down a bit of a rabbit hole in terms of trying to rework the .put and .delete methods, or at least how they were initialized client-side.  Ultimately it went nowhere.  Did some Codewars, poked at my Anki deck (but not to the degree I should have), and worked a bit on the first PassportJS tutorial.

**Thoughts:** I understand hardly anything of the workings of Passport.  I can get the gist, though, so I should probably just take what Leon always say to heart and remind myself that I don't really need to understand exactly what's happening under the hood.  Not at this stage in my career, at least.  I need to have a hard think about what I want to get done in the next two weeks.



### Day 44: June 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did not feel like I really made headway with anything, unfortunately.  German + errands took up most of the morning, leaving me a little time to work on the blog post, which is spiraling out of hand.  I ran into some irritating bugs and, although I fixed them in the end, was so annoyed and frustrated that I didn't really get back to the project.  Did some Codewars and Anki after dinner.

**Thoughts:** On the one hand, I hate starting something and not finishing it.  On the other hand, this blog post is turning into a bloated nightmare that's rapidly getting out of my control.  I've spent days on this, days that I could have spent on something useful.  The posts are nice, but they aren't going to be what gets me a job in the end.  Time to cut my losses; going forward I need to be much, much stricter about the amount of time I spend working on these side projects.



### Day 45: June 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked my way through the first Passport.js tutorial.  Did several Codewars and more Anki than usual, tried once again to implement a "no client-side JS" thing on my boardgame site, and once again failed.  Went to the Laravel talk and marvelled at a starter kit that delivered API keys straight out of the box.

**Thoughts:** Honestly having a bit of a downward swing to my mood lately.  With the downturn in the market, people on Twitter crowing about the bright future of No Code tools, fellow #100Devs posting their cool projects, and a bunch of people on the Discord channel talking about recruiters reaching out to them, etc. etc., I'm starting to feel hopelessness creeping back in.  I hope I can get things up and running with Passport tomorrow.  I need a success right now.



### Day 46: June 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Another discouraging day.  Watched one of the videos from the previous cohort about user authentication, and while I do feel that I came away understanding a bit more, I had mixed feelings about Leon's approach.  I don't really want to tie anything to a Microsoft login (and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get an Azure client key).  Tried to start a new project but it quickly became apparent that what I was trying to do was going to be VASTLY more difficult than it appeared.

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time at the computer today with nothing to show for it.  Feeling very discouraged.  I am probably going about the projects the wrong way; I want to build some show-stopper project straight out of the gate, but the reality is that I don't have the knowledge or the capacity for that.  I need to set my sights on something smaller to start with.



### Day 47: June 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I stepped away from the user authentication and instead worked on my Boardgame Library app.  One of the problems I'd had yesterday was being unable to figure out how to handle a fetch on the server side:  a fetch prompted by a client-side POST request, so effectively I ended up with a promise inside of a promise.  I did solve the problem (I was probably overthinking it), but didn't do much else aside from some Codewars and ANKI.

**Thoughts:** Baby steps.



### Day 48: June 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Since I'm working the bar tonight, I decided that I *really* wanted to have some part of my drinks app finished so I could test it out a bit.  Spent the day working on concatenating promises and filtering the resulting arrays.  Ultimately succeeded; the next step will be building out the larger recipe card.  I had already done most of the heavy lifting on that, so in theory it shouldn't be too difficult.

**Thoughts:** As ever, it feels like it takes me far too long to do things.  I am sure it will improve in time, and I don't do myself any favors with my line of thinking.  "This would be so simple for an experienced programmer..."  well, yes, but I'm not an experienced programmer, now am I?  So why on earth would I hold myself to that standard?



### Day 49: June 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Got once again caught up in a particular project, in this case the Drinks Cabinet.  I fleshed out the functions, added objects, sorted the recipe card modal, and in general made a whole host of improvements.  The basic functionality is now there; I just need to add the rest of the search options (and decide what I'm going to do about the inconsistent ones), and style the thing.

**Thoughts:** I'm really pleased with what I got done today.  I'm trying not to dwell on how long it took me to do it.  An experienced developer could have done it in a fraction of the time, sure, but I'm not an experienced developer so I don't know why I feel compelled to hold myself to that standard.



### Day 50: June 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Looked over ShesWithUs and realized what a horrible job I'd done.  Made a list of things that needed fixing.  Worked a little on the Drinks Cabinet.  Making an autofill search list, with the option to add additional search bars, is the obvious solution to the "way too many search options" problem.

**Thoughts:** Getting ShesWithUs portfolio-ready is going to be more work than I'd anticipated, but I think it will still be worthwhile, as it's an experience that looks good and that I would be happy to talk about.  Still, it's not quite the "easy win" that I'd been hoping for!  (Yet it is somewhat gratifying to see how far I've come since the start of April.)



### Day 51: June 27, 2022 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on Raymond's website.  Got the general layout down and built out the hero and "about" sections.  

**Thoughts:**  It felt good to finally have something to show Raymond.  (About time, too!)  I drew on a lot of what I'd written for my portfolio; at some point I will have to go back and organize my code snippets a little better, though.




### Day 52: June 28, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did more work on Raymond's site and finished with a more-or-less complete homepage (though the styling of some sections is still a little off, it needs completed copy, and I haven't yet sorted out the carousel).  Fiddled with the Drinks Cabinet.  I needed a list to populate the autofill menu, and ended up deciding to make a list-making app.

**Thoughts:** I'm happy to have something to show Raymond, and somewhat less happy that I let myself wander off on a tangent with the list-making app.  On the bright side, the ease with which I coded it reassures me that I do know what I'm doing, at least to some degree.




### Day 53: June 29, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued to build out the list-maker.  Added most of the functionality that I wanted, though the way that I had put it together was a bit ropey.  I built it using localStorage, which was useful in that I'd largely forgotten how to use localStorage.  This was a good opportunity to relearn.  I also got to play with JSON.parse() and .stringify()

**Thoughts:**  Pleased with how the list-maker turned out, and I feel like I have a pretty solid little idea that I can then convert into something using a database and CRUD functions.




### Day 54: June 30

**Today's Progress:** Returned to working on Raymond's site, in anticipation of seeing him this morning.  I wanted to have a working carousel, and finally broke down and started investigating SwiperJS.  Although the initial implementation gave me some hassles, eventually I got it working.

**Thoughts:**  As much as I hate not building things myself, using a module did make it much easier.  I'm not terribly happy with the appearance of a lot of the pieces, though, and will need to do some more tweaking.  The trouble with not knowing what you're doing is that tweaking the bits becomes vastly more difficult, but that has always been my problem with templates and modules and such:  if you don't know, they're hard to work with.  If you do know, why would you need to work with them in the first place?  (I suppose that if I did know, they'd still save me time, as I could drop something in and tweak it quickly.)



### Day 55: July 1, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  While attempting to use my list-maker for its stated purpose, I discovered that the "improvement" that I had made (attaching an edit function to each individual list rather than having one where you selected the list and then edited it), actually broke the editing.  Trying to fix the problem turned into a cycle where every fix introduced a new problem.  The real fault lay with how I'd built the thing in the first place.  The fault lay with the underlying architecture; I was just slapping paint onto the walls while the foundation was crumbling.

**Thoughts:**  The best way to improve the app would be to rewrite it in an OOP style.  Being so deep into it, it was hard to take a step back and survey the real problem.  Also, converting it to something that connects with a database would solve a lot of problems; trying to constantly update and deal with localStorage data is a real PITA.



### Day 56: July 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I wanted to learn about Mongoose, so got started with FCC's Backend Development/APIs course.  A lot of it seems outdated and getting started with it was frustrating, but I do feel that I learned something; I have a much better understanding of what's going on with middleware, at the least.

**Thoughts:**  Not sure if the struggles I ran into were due to poor explanations or my own ignorance.  There were definitely moments where I felt like there must be some supplementary material somewhere that I had missed; probably one was expected to have gone through FCC's JS course before jumping into this.  Although the problems I encountered were with regards to installing modules and such (many of which were outdated or depreciated; I am halfway tempted to offer up my services in rewriting some of this course, or at least offering suggestions -- contributing to a FCC course would be quite a feather in my cap, no?)



### Day 57: July 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued working with the FCC course, though I got completely stuck with Mongoose.  Did a CRUD template review with some other members of the EU study group.

**Thoughts:** The FCC course continues to frustrate.  Part of my problem is that I don't really understand what's going on "under the hood" and am perhaps, as I told Kirstie, trying to control too much when I really should sit back and "let Mongoose take the wheel."  I was very pleased with my performance at the CRUD review, though; getting started, doing all the installation and connecting the pieces was a breeze, and the struggles I'd had with Heroku did enable me to instruct everyone else on how to manage deployment from GitHub.  Also answered questions and generally felt like I really did know what I was doing, which made for a nice change.



### Day 58: July 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued chipping away at the FCC course.  Managed to get through the Mongoose section and am onto the project parts.

**Thoughts:** I had the strong sensation that I was missing something while doing the Mongoose problems.  Once I saw the sample code and figured out the pattern, the remaining problems were easy enough to "solve," but I wouldn't've have been able to solve them on my own.  Frustrating.  Though how FCC presents the code really makes me wonder just how long ago this course was written; it seems to be crying out for an update.  Noticed that MDN has some tutorials on Express that incorporate Mongoose, so will have a look at them, and at the video Kirstie recommended, tomorrow.  FCC's approach was so weird that I honestly don't feel that I've learned much of anything.  The Mongoose functions were completely removed from the server-side code, and while in an architectural sense that's probably best practice, it makes it hard for me to understand what's happening.

(As an aside, editing this file is getting more and more painful.  I think I may have to split it off to a "Part 2" pretty soon.)
