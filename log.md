# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished Class 27 of #100Devs and coded along with Leon as he made a basic card game.  Added some additional fields to my NASA Photo of the Day site, including a date picker, and refactored the code to make it MUCH cleaner.  To do:  use localStorage to allow users to save their favorite images and access them later.

**Thoughts:** I was pleased to be able to keep up with Leon, even at 1.5 speed, though between the Cocktail picker and what I'd already done with the NASA site, I feel like I've got a pretty good handle on how to manipulate API data and insert it into the DOM.  From time to time I think about how I might implement some of this stuff using the OOP model, but I still don't have a very good grasp of that.

### Day 2: April 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Wrote and published the Pitch Generator that I'd been thinking about.  Did a 6 kyu CodeWars problem and felt very good about it.  (My initial solution was spot on; it just ran into some issues with case sensitivity that I hadn't anticipated but could easily solve.)

**Thoughts:**  The JS portion of my Pitch Generator worked flawlessly (once I remembered to add the script tag to the HTML!).  Styling the page took me some time, but I'm very pleased with how it turned out.  Also, I probably shouldn't laugh at my own jokes so much.  I  still need to return to the NASA site and do two more simple API sites.

### Day 3: April 18, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started and finished the JS portion of the Trivia Trainer project.

**Thoughts:** Creating a mental map of the project was a bit difficult, and I kept going around in circles.  Had to stop myself at one point and start from the beginning, just to see if I could get the basics to work; my inclination, as usual, was to write EVERYTHING and then test.  Was pleased that I managed to stop myself and take it step by step.  At one point I felt I had coded myself into a corner in terms of being able to test the answers, but after consulting with my father and taking another look, I came up with a solution.
<br><br>In the end, I managed to get it working, although I didn't have time to do any CSS.  Will have to make another pass and style it before I could put it into my portfolio.  It would also be a good candidate for conversion to an OOP approach.

### Day 4: April 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Was out of the house for most of the day, but got started on a "Quote of the Day" generator.

**Thoughts:** I spent way too long trying to solve a CORS error without knowing what it was.  If I'd bothered to do a tiny bit of research, I would have learned that it wasn't my fault and that there was nothing I could have done about it.  As usual, I am my own worst enemy.

### Day 5: April 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the "Quote of the Day" page.

**Thoughts:** I kept changing my mind about what I actually wanted the page to do, and that caused me to spend a long time going around in circles.  In the future, I need to come up with a clear plan and stick to it.  I also struggled to work with the results I was getting back from Lorem Picsum.  The end result was that this project took me a lot longer than it should have done, considering how simple it is.

### Day 6: April 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Coded along with Class 28, though it was mostly a review of things I'd already done with my own projects; I didn't feel that I really learned anything.  Made a list of improvements I'd like to make to my API projects but didn't do any work on them; instead I restarted Codecademy's Intro to JS course as a refresher and worked on improving my Anki deck.

**Thoughts:** I didn't really do any coding today aside from following along with Leon; the Codecademy stuff is so basic that I can't really count it.  I'm largely trying to avoid working on my resume and portfolio, and that is a bad habit to get in to.  On the other hand, I *am* technically on vacation right now.



### Day 7: April 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued to work through the Codecademy JS course, did several Codewars problems, and added many more cards to my Anki deck.

**Thoughts:** I flew through the JS course before and now I'm doing it even more quickly.  If I want more JS practice, it would be a good idea to start freecodecamp's JS unit and complete the fundamentals track of TOP.  In short, there's plenty of practice material out there.



### Day 8: April 23, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added functions to the NASA Image of the Day site to allow users to add and remove favorites.

**Thoughts:**  Very happy with how this went.  As usual, I stumbled on a few typo-induced errors, but there was nothing wrong with the reasoning behind my approach.  It would do me good to learn more about Sets, Dates, and the HTMLInputElement interface.

### Day 9: April 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Worked through another section of Codeacdemy's Intro to JS course (again, amazing how much faster it's going this time; I really have made progress!) and did the Intro to UI/UX course.

**Thoughts:** Knowing all of this jargon would have been helpful when I was doing the hackathon project!  A lot of it still feels like bullshit, but there are some useful bits of information to be gleaned from the design methodologies; if nothing else, it's given me something to think about when I consider what sort of features I want to include in a project.  And it has definitely given me a better handle on how to approach the visual design stage of a project, rather than just leaping into the CSS and imagining that it will all magically work out with enough tweaking.



### Day 10: April 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Quickly wrote some CSS to solve a problem my father was having, talked him through it, wrote some more.  A low-code day.

**Thoughts:** Although I didn't do a lot, it felt good to help my father out (and even better to have known something that he didn't know).  I should take more time in my day to share knowledge.  It feels good and it's good for me.



### Day 11: April 26, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Less progress than I would have liked.  Did some Codewars and a little more of the Codecademy JS course, but the day was mostly taken up by the family.

**Thoughts:** As much as I know I shouldn't begrudge my kids and parents for the time I spend with them, it's hard not to feel frustrated when I finish a day and feel that I haven't really gone forward.  And as the next several days are going to be busy, I doubt I'll be getting a lot done until the weekend.  Oh well.
